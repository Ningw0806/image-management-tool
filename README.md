# image-management-tool
The application allows users to select an image file, convert it to a different format, and save the converted file. The application provides a user interface with a 'ComboBox' to choose the output format, an 'ImageView' to display the selected image, and a Label to provide information about the image (such as its width and height). Once the image is converted to the selected format, the user can save the converted file to their computer.

The application was developed using JavaFX, a popular Java library for building desktop applications with rich user interfaces. JavaFX provides a wide range of components to create responsive and user-friendly desktop applications. The application also uses 'javax.imageio' and 'java.awt.image' classes to read and write image files, which are part of the Java standard library.
